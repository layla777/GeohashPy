2019-06-25: Version 0.9.0 released
  - Initial beta release with foundational functionality.

2020-07-03: Version 0.9.1 released
  - Code update to use `@staticmethod` for relevant methods.

2024-11-23: Version 1.0.0 released
  - Initial release.

2024-12-16: Version 1.1.0a released
  - Refactored code for improved readability and performance.
  - Enhanced documentation in `README.md` with additional details.
  - Added the following new test and profiling scripts:
    - `edge_test.py`
    - `geohash_precision_test.py`
    - `geohash_profiling.py`
    - `geohash_test.py`

[Notes on New Test and Profiling Scripts]
  In this alpha release, the following test and profiling scripts have been introduced:

  - `edge_test.py`: Designed to test edge cases of geohash functionality.
  - `geohash_precision_test.py`: Evaluates the precision accuracy of geohash calculations.
  - `geohash_profiling.py`: Provides profiling for geohash algorithm efficiency.
  - `geohash_test.py`: General tests to validate geohash-related features.

  **These scripts and their placement are currently under review and will be progressively documented and organized for the final 1.1.0 release.** Preparation and adjustments will be made incrementally and in order of readiness to ensure quality.
[Current Status]
  - This release is an **alpha version** (1.1.0a) and is not feature-complete.
  - It serves as a preliminary release for evaluation and continued development toward Version 1.1.0 (Formal Release).

[TODO for Version 1.1.0]
  - Add and publish `README_ja.md` to provide Japanese documentation.
  - Conduct comprehensive testing of the new test and profiling scripts:
    - `edge_test.py`
    - `geohash_precision_test.py`
    - `geohash_profiling.py`
    - `geohash_test.py`
  - Resolve any issues or bugs reported during alpha testing.
  - Further refine code for performance optimization.
  - Ensure all documentation is finalized and up-to-date (including additional language support as needed).
  - My English is bad: never to be fixed unless free and better-quality translation technologies emerge.

[Future Roadmap]

Version 1.2.0 (Upcoming):
  - Feature: Add geohash-based distance calculation functionality.
  - Plan to thoroughly test edge cases and validate results with geographical datasets.

Version 1.3.0 (Upcoming):
  - Feature: Integrate Numpy for advanced mathematical operations to improve computational performance.
  - Ensure compatibility with all existing modules and test new features rigorously.
